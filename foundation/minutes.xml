</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Søren</em>: Which version of Spring Boot will Grails 6 support?
<ul>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: The latest version that still supports JDK11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grails 4 EOS
<ul>
<li><em>Jason</em>: With Grails 6 M1 being delayed until January, I would prefer to extend maintenance support for Grails 4 through March</li>
<li><em>Søren</em>: I don’t think it makes sense to support 3 versions at one time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updates to Grails Plugins
<ul>
<li><em>Søren</em>: I’ve been updating some plugins in GPC to Grails 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CVE Updates
<ul>
<li><em>Jason</em>: We have had two critical CVEs in the past year and I wanted to check in with the group on our communication around those.  Is everyone here aware of the CVEs?</li>
<li><em>Ken</em>: I didn’t see it but I may have missed it</li>
<li><em>Jen</em>: We did a blog post for each one along with updates to Twitter and LinkedIn.  Twitter posts also publish in Grails Slack channel</li>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: <em>Sent a link to the tweet for the most recent CVE</em></li>
<li><em>Jason</em>: In addition to seeing the updates.  We’ve also not been publishing technical details of the vulnerabilities right away in order to give folks time to patch their applications.  How do you all feel about that approach?</li>
<li><em>Ken</em>: It sounds like you are doing the right things and I may have just missed it</li>
<li><em>Paul</em>: Most people don’t publish technical details right away and many times the CVE will eventually be updated to include technical details.  Also, many people review the CVE database itself to be notified of vulnerabilities against their dependencies and so for some folks that will be the way they find out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Twitter Alternatives for Public Communication
<ul>
<li><em>Ken</em>: Has there been any consideration of creating a Mastadon account for Grails?</li>
<li><em>Paul</em>: I’ve created a Mastadon account for Groovy but haven’t started using it yet</li>
<li><em>Jen</em>: It would be nice if we could have it where when we post one somewhere it would go to both so we don’t have so many to maintain</li>
<li><em>Jason</em>: I think it would be good to investigate.  I think Mastadon is where a number of tech people are ending up and it would be good to be there if we think it will be viable long term</li>
<li><em>Paul</em>: There are some tools that will send messages to multiple platforms</li>
<li><em>Jen</em>: We will evaluate if this is something that we want to pursue</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grails Framework Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review of JDK Support in Grails framework 6 from last meeting
<ul>
<li>The plan is to base Grails framework 6 on JDK 11</li>
<li>Paul: The Groovy community is a little split on if Groovy 5 should be JDK 8, 11, or 17.  It will only impact future versions of the Grails framework that use Groovy 5, so shouldn’t be a concern for Grails framework 6
<ul>
<li>https://twitter.com/ApacheGroovy/status/1524255310923595776</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Grails CLI
<ul>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: Plan is to have the new CLI available as an option in Grails 5 and then make it the standard in Grails 6.  If we are unable to get the CLI complete in time for Grails 6, we will release it as an option in Grails 6.</li>
<li><em>Jason</em>: Polled the group to see who uses custom templates / profiles from the CLI.  Tabitha does.
<ul>
<li><em>Jason</em>: When we update the Grails CLI to the new version based on Micronaut there will be some changes to how custom commands and profiles are done.  I think it would be good for us to review those with the group.</li>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: Reviewed tentative updates for the new CLI
<ul>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: current commands written as an <code>ApplicationCommand</code> should continue to work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Tabitha</em>: As far as the templates, what we did was create a custom plugin for the templates with a command that updates the templates, so I don’t think your change will impact us.</li>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: I would like to demo this to the tab once it is in a presentable state.</li>
<li><em>James</em>: I think there will be some things that won’t immediately translate with the new CLI but it should be easier to extend and understand once the change is made.  I personally feel like the pros outweigh the cons there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grails framework 4 End of Support
<ul>
<li><em>Jason</em>: The tentative date for end of support for Grails framework 4 is at the end of this year.  That is dependent on the release of Grails 6.  By the end of the year, Grails 6 should be released, 5 should move to active maintenance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: I had some presentations accepted for ApacheCon.  I don’t know the full schedule yet but I’m looking forward to presenting.
<ul>
<li><em>Paul</em>: Here is the tentative schedule: https://www.apachecon.com/acna2022/schedule.html</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Puneet</em>: Currently the Grails Plugin Portal goes down very often, but I know James we had some plans of making it completely static and I’d like some feedback on the priority of that
<ul>
<li>TAB talked through static site generation options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Søren</em>: The CFP for GR8 Conf is open and we are always looking for speakers
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Grails Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grails 5.1.1 (20 December)</li>
<li>Grails Database Migration 4.0.0-RC3</li>
<li>Spring Security Core Plugin</li>
<li>Leveling-up Grails CLI</li>
<li>Consolidating Grails Plugin from different Github repos</li>
<li>Spring Loaded work has been ongoing to support JDK 11
<ul>
<li>It works for most projects now but large projects have issues</li>
<li>David Estes is working on determining the cause of that now</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech Talk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on JDK Version for Grails 6
<ul>
<li>Ken: Has there been a plan on the move to JDK 11 and JDK 17 in accordance with the Spring change?</li>
<li>David: Yes and no</li>
<li>Jason: There was some discussion last time about this, and it is worth bringing up again. The question is what is the appetite from the community on the support for the latest Spring Boot, which will require the JDK 17 baseline. I support having a Grails 6 release with Groovy 4, but supporting the current major version of Spring Boot instead of jumping to JDK 17 all at once</li>
<li>Søren: From the perspective of a customer, they have been going through all of the work from Grails 2 to 4; they are scared of something big coming again. Going through smaller increments seems to be a benefit</li>
<li>James: I would consider sticking to Java 8 for Grails 6</li>
<li>David: I think that could be a problem because 8 is out of support and a lot of libraries are switching to a baseline of 11</li>
<li>Ken: So what are you suggesting?</li>
<li>James: I think there are benefits to sticking with 8 mainly in that there are a lot of organizations that are still using Java 8, and I don’t think switching to 11 brings any large benefits to the framework</li>
<li>David: Asset Pipeline will be baselined to Java 11, so if the latest version of that will remain with Grails it will need to be updated. Also 8 is going out of support</li>
<li>Ken: I think by the end of the year, 11 will be the dominant version</li>
<li>Tabitha: I think we should be moving up. We are trying to move off of 8 for some of the support reasons mentioned</li>
<li>James: The rationale for continuing to support it would be that there are a lot of people that are stuck on 8</li>
<li>Tabitha: If we do maintain 8, what is going to be the level of effort to maintain that to those customers</li>
<li>Søren: From my point of view, if Grails 6 were to be Java 11, that would pull major customers out of JDK 8</li>
<li>David: I think people in education and government will be forced to move to 11</li>
<li>Puneet: Maybe we could stick with 8 for now and put this off a few months and see where we are at in terms of 11</li>
<li>Ken: I think if we stay on 8, it looks like we aren’t keeping up or updating anything</li>
<li>James: I don’t think there is a lot in 11 that benefits the framework while there are a lot of benefits in 17</li>
<li>David: I’m going to need to switch asset pipeline to 11 either way in order to support newer ECMA Script features. I can support the older version for a while, but it needs to move</li>
<li><strong>Polled the group for advice on if Grails 6 should baseline on JDK 8 or 11</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ken: 11</li>
<li>Tabitha: 11</li>
<li>Søren: 11</li>
<li>David: 11</li>
<li>James: 8</li>
<li>Jason: 11</li>
<li>Puneet: 8</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ken: I primarily do training and it has been a long time since folks have asked for a Grails training class. I’m concerned that if we don’t keep current, we are giving the impression that we aren’t keeping up</li>
<li>David: I’ve noticed that when we say that people can write a Groovy module for our product that some people get excited about that but some others wonder why it isn’t Python or some other language</li>
<li>David: Also, Rails had a period where interest wasn’t as high, and now they are really popular again in the Ruby community, so we could see what sort of things they did</li>
</ul>
</li>
