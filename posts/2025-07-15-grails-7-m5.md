Full Changelog: [v[%priorVersion]...v[%version]](https://github.com/apache/grails-core/compare/v[%priorVersion]...v[%version])

Upgrade instructions are available in the [documentation](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/single.html#upgrading60x). 

## Dependency Upgrades
In this release, we've upgraded several dependency versions, including but not limited to the following:

* Asset Pipeline 5.0.12 (now cloud.wondrify.asset-pipeline)
* Groovy 4.0.27
* Spring Framework 6.2.8
* Spring Boot 3.5.3

* See all in the [grails-bom](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/ref/Versions/Grails%20BOM.html).

## Generating a new Grails [%version] application with Grails Forge
Try out Grails today by visiting our online application generator [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org/).  This is the quickest and the recommended way to get started with Grails.

After installing the JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA [Grails Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18504-grails), the Grails Application Forge will also be available under New Project in IntelliJ IDEA. 

Within your newly generated project you can access the Grails CLIs with the grails wrapper

See [Types of CLI](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/gettingStarted.html#downloadingAndInstalling) for details on each CLI

grail-shell-cli

```shell
grailsw
```

grails-forge-cli

```shell
grailsw -t forge
```

## Installing Grails CLIs [%version] with SDKMan
Alternatively, you can quickly install Grails [%version] CLIs (grails-shell-cli and grails-forge-cli) using [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/).

See [Types of CLI](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/gettingStarted.html#downloadingAndInstalling) for details on each CLI

1. If you don't have SDKMan installed, follow the instructions at [SDKMan Installation Guide](https://sdkman.io/install/)
   to set it up.
2. Once SDKMan is installed, open your terminal and run the following command to install Grails [%version]:

    ```shell
    sdk install grails [%version]
    ```

3. You're all set! To verify the installation, run:

    ```shell
    grails --version
    ```

The Grails Shell CLI can be accessed as:

```shell
grails
``` 
or
```shell
grails-shell-cli
```
The Grails Forge CLI can be accessed as:
```shell
grails -t forge
```
or
```shell
grails-forge-cli
```    

## Upgrading Your Existing Applications to Grails [%version]
If you already have a Grails application and want to upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (preferably JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Update your application's `gradle.properties` file to specify Grails [%version] as the desired version.

    ```properties
    grailsVersion=[%version]
    ```

3. Make any necessary adjustments to your application code, configuration, and dependencies to ensure compatibility with
   the new version. [See Upgrade Guide](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/single.html#upgrading60x)

Normally, Grails Core dependencies are automatically updated using the Grails Bill of Materials (BOM). However, if you
have specific versions defined in your build configuration, you may need to manually update them to align with
Grails [%version].

By following these steps, you should be able to transition your existing Grails application to Grails [%version].

### Exploring Alternative Approaches
If manual dependency updates seem daunting, or you want a more streamlined approach, consider the following alternatives:

#### 1. Use Grails Forge Website
Visit [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org) and generate a new Grails application with Grails [%version]. Compare the
versions in the newly generated application with your existing one to identify any discrepancies. This can serve as a
reference point for your update.

#### 2. Automated Dependency Update Bots
Configure automated dependency update bots like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) or
[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) with your source control platform (e.g., GitHub). These bots can automatically
detect and update outdated dependencies in your project, including Grails dependencies, saving you time and effort in
manual updates.

With these steps and alternative approaches, you should be well on your way to enjoying the exciting features and
improvements in Grails [%version].

## Why should you try out Grails [%version]?
* Help us test this major upgrade of the Grails Framework and provide feedback.
* Be ready for when Grails 7 is released.

## Grails 7 Release Schedule
* We will continue to work on [updating and fixing issues](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/487) over the next few
  weeks.
* Based on feedback, an Apache Grails RC release is targeted for July/August 2025.
